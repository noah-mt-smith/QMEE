1. You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive. 

What is the probability that they have MMV?

Using Bayes, we can calculate the desired probability.

P(MMV|positive) = (P(positive|MMV)*P(MMV))/P(positive)

based on the info in the question, we know that 

P(MMV) = 0.01
P(positive|MMV) = 1
P(positive|no_MMV) = 0.05

Although we don't know P(pos), we can easily calculate it with the above values.

Imagine a population of 100 people. We know that 1 person has MMV, and that 1 person will test positive (since P(positive|MMV) = 1). We know that 99 others don't have the virus, but 5% of them will test positive (since P(positive|no_MMV) = 0.05). 99 people * 0.05 = 4.95. So, the total amount of positive tests in a population of 100 people would be 5.95 (or 6 if we round)

P(pos) = P(positive|MMV) + P(positive|no_MMV) = 1 + 4.95 = 5.95

Now we can calculate the probability of the randomly selected individual (with a positive test) having MMV.

P(MMV|positive) = (P(positive|MMV)*P(MMV))/P(positive)

P(MMV|positive) = (1*0.01)/5.95 = 0.168

Therefore, the probability of having MMV given a positive test result is 0.168. 

2. You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?

I'm not sure what I could tell them without more information. I know the baseline positive rate in the population is 5.95%, but the test can't tell them anything difinitive unless we have more info. What are their symptoms? For example, if they begin insisting that we should stop cherishing p-values and should instead supplement them with effect sizes and confidence intervals, I would likely encourage them to visit their local statistician for a more expert opinion.


HYPOTHESIS FOR MY DATA: 

I predict that humans are biased towards rewarding winners. I predict that, when given a choice to allocate finite funds and coaching hours to winners and losers, participants will allocate greater than 0.5 of their available funds and coaching hours to the winner.

I will test my prediction using a one-sample permutation test using the {EnvStats} package. I will compare my observed distribution to a null distribution that centers around 0.5.

I will do this for both the proportion of funds allocated to winners and the proportion of coaching hours allocated to the winners.

I initially thought a one-sample t-test would be appropriate (comparing my data to mu = 0.5), but I believe that a one-sample permutation test is more appropriate, as it makes fewer assumptions about the data and may therefore provide a more robust measure.
