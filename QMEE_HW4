1. You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive. 

What is the probability that they have MMV?

Using Bayes, we can calculate the desired probability.

P(MMV|positive) = (P(positive|MMV)*P(MMV))/P(positive)

based on the info in the question, we know that 

P(MMV) = 0.01
P(positive|MMV) = 1
P(positive|no_MMV) = 0.05

Although we don't know P(pos), we can easily calculate it with the above values.

Imagine a population of 100 people. We know that 1 person has MMV, and that 1 person will test positive (since P(positive|MMV) = 1). We know that 99 others don't have the virus, but 5% of them will test positive (since P(positive|no_MMV) = 0.05). 99 people * 0.05 = 4.95. So, the total amount of positive tests in a population of 100 people would be 5.95 (or 6 if we round)

P(pos) = P(positive|MMV) + P(positive|no_MMV) = 1 + 4.95 = 5.95

Now we can calculate the probability of the randomly selected individual (who tested positive) having MMV.

P(MMV|positive) = (P(positive|MMV)*P(MMV))/P(positive)

P(MMV|positive) = (1*0.01)/5.95 = 0.168

Therefore, the probability of having MMV given a positive test result is 0.168. 

2. You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?

I'm not sure what I could tell them without more information. I know the baseline positive rate in the population is 5.95%, but the test can't tell them anything definitive unless we know more--for example, what are their symptoms? If they began insisting that we should stop cherishing p-values and should instead supplement them with effect sizes and confidence intervals, I would likely encourage them to visit their local statistician for a more expert opinion.


HYPOTHESIS FOR MY DATA: 

For data, see the file WL_soc_clean.csv. The below predictions correspond to the columns "prop.money.to.winner" and "prop.coach.to.winner".

I predict that humans are biased towards rewarding winners. When given a choice to allocate finite funds and coaching hours to winners and losers in a fictional story, I predict that participants will allocate greater than 0.5 of their available funds and coaching hours to the winner.

I will test my prediction using a one-sample permutation test using the {EnvStats} package. I will compare my observed distribution to a null distribution that centers around 0.5.

I will do this for both the proportion of funds allocated to winners and the proportion of coaching hours allocated to the winners.

I initially thought a one-sample t-test would be appropriate (comparing my data to mu = 0.5), but I believe that a one-sample permutation test is more appropriate, as it makes fewer assumptions about the data and likely provides a more robust measure. 

Although the permutation test will provide me with a p-value, I should also calculate 95% confidence intervals for both funds allocated to winners and coaching hours allocated to winners. I can observe how these confidence intervals interact with my null hypothesis of 0.5 money allocated to both winners and losers. If my confidence intervals crossed 0.5, it wouldn't necessarily mean that there is no effect, it would just mean that the effect is unclear given my study and statistics. Furthermore, based on prior knowledge of studies in related fields, I consider a difference of about 0.10 in allocation between winners and losers (i.e., 0.55 to winners, 0.45 to losers, or vice versa), could be considered a "large" effect. I would thus set "cutoffs" about 0.05 above and 0.05 below my baseline of 0.5.
