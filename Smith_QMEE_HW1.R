#Noah Smith QMEE HW1

# See "QMEE_WL_social_data.csv" for the dataset used to conduct this one-sample
# t-test.

# Also, see "README.md" for an explanation of how the dataset was collected, 
# the context of the experiment, and our main explicit predictions. 

# Our prediction was that participants would allocate significantly more 
# funds and coaching hours to winners than to losers. We can statistically 
# test these predictions with two one-sample t-tests with mu = 0.5
# (for both proportion of money allocated to winner and proportion of coaching
# hours allocated to winner).
