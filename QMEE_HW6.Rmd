Question 1b:

My two main response variables (proportion of funds allocated to winner and proportion of coaching hours allocated to winner) are continuous variables on the ratio scale. This means that, if participant A allocates 0.8 of their funds to the winner and participant B allocates 0.1 of their funds to the winner, participant A has allocated 8 times as much. And if participant C allocated 0.4 of their funds to the winner, they allocated half of what participant A allocated and 4 times what participant B allocated. I can therefore take the mean of my response variable, as that is a meaningful measure. If my response variables had been nominal (e.g., "all funds to winner", or "no funds to winner"), then such a measure would be meaningless.
