# Assignment 1 dataset description and explicit prediction: 

# I collected this dataset as part of my Fall 2023 experiment. In our first experiments, my supervisor and I tested whether randomly assigned winners performed better than randomly assigned losers in a subsequent, standardized round. Our results suggested that randomly assigned prior winners performed better than randomly assigned prior losers in a subsequent, standardized round (Smith & Dukas, 2024). Our Fall 2023 experiment examined another aspect of winning and losing: how we react to the wins and losses of others. We randomly assigned participants to read one of eight possible passages about a dyadic competition (one winner; one loser) between two fictional individuals. After participants read the passage, we asked them to distribute two finite resources (money and coaching hours) between the two competitors. We predicted that participants would favour winners (allocate more money and coaching hours to them) out of a desire to affiliate with the winner. Affiliating with more competent or athletic individuals could be beneficial to fitness, especially in the context of our ancestral environments--strong coalitions and good reciprocal trading partners may have been vital to survival and reproduction. To mitigate potential confounds present in the reading passages (such as competitive context, character age, or character names), we randomized participants to read one of eight passages, each of the eight being a different combination of competitive context (athletic; academic), character age (elementary; high school), and character and school name (Jamie and East Hills; Morgan and West Lake).  

# We predicted that participants would allocate a greater proportion of money and coaching hours to the winner of the fictional competition.

# In "NS_QMEE_hw1.R", I run two one-sample t-tests on whether participants allocated greater than 0.5 of their money and coaching hours to the winner.

# In this study, we also attempted to measure participants' perceptions of population variation in the traits of "intelligence" and "athleticism". Surprisingly, we know of no data that explicitly measures how humans perceive variation in ability within their population. The ability to perceive how individuals or group members vary in different skills may play an important role in our tendency to favour winners (if such a tendency exists). To understand how people perceive variation in the traits of intelligence and athleticism, we provided participants with a multiple-choice survey that included five graphical depictions of populations ranging from "low" to "high" variance (low meaning more population members grouped towards the average, high meaning fewer population members grouped towards the average). The participant then indicated which of the five graphical depictions aligned with their impressions of population variation, first for intelligence and then for athleticism.

# To construct the distributions we used for intelligence, we began with the standardized IQ distribution as a baseline, which has a standard deviation of 1. When creating the graphical depictions for the 5 population distribution options, we used the middle (third) option as a baseline, and thus made its standard deviation equal to 1 (identical to the standard IQ distribution). Options 1 and 2 were graphical representations of populations with a standard deviation (in intelligence) of 0.33 and 0.5, respectively. Options 4 and 5 were graphical representations of populations with a standard deviation (in intelligence) of 2 and 3, respectively. I.e., participants could respond by picking any of five populations, which had standard deviations in intelligence of 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 (although participants could not actually see these numbers).

# For the athleticism distributions, we searched far and wide for strong data on true "athleticism" variation. However, much of the good athletic data comes from professional sports organizations (e.g., the NFL's yearly combine data). Unfortunately, such data suffers from large ceiling effects--e.g., the 100-yard dash data published by the NFL combine has a strong left skew. Thus we reused the standard deviation values from our IQ distributions--to indicate their perception of athleticism variation in the population, participants could choose 1 of 5 populations with standard deviations of 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3.
